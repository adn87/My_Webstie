        <p class="lead">One of my favorite hobbies is to travel even though I started enjoying this hobby kind of late,
        but like they say better late than never. So far I've been to: Cuba, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Dubai, Saudi
        Arabia, Thailand. My plan is to travel more when the opportunity presents itself.</p>
        <p class="lead">Another hobby of mine is cooking. I love all kinds of food and I love trying new food
        especially food from different cultures.</p>
        <p class="lead">Some other hobbies: I like hitting the gym in my free time, going to the 'beach' in the summer
        and play beach volleyball (if you want to call them beaches in ottawa ðŸ˜…)</p>
